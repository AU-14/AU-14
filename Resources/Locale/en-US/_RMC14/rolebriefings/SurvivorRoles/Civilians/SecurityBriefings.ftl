security-role-briefing = [font size=12][color=white]As an on-duty Bureau security officer, you held the peace aboard {$planet}, keeping the colonists cooperative and monitoring for terrorist activity. You did well - until the sirens started blaring. Your partner sacrificed their life in order to send out the all-distress. You've been doing your best to survive against the horrors since. It's an all-out survival situation now - 11-60 all the way. Do your best to keep any and all survivors safe - even the ones dressed in red. [/font][/color][color=red][bold]

    You ARE aware of the alien threat, and the distress signal, but not the marines or their intentions.[/bold][/color]
