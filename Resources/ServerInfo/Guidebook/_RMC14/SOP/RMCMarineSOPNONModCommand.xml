  # NON-Modifiable Command SOP

  ## Forward Operating Bases

  The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] in charge of an operation must take the minimum precautions to ensure security and defense for stationed personnel, and incoming transport, when designating an Forward Operating Base.

  - The FOB must be a [bold]Secure Area[/bold] and designated by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color].
  - The FOB does not have to be placed adjacent to a landing zone, but the primary landing zone still requires its outlined defenses.

  ## Secure Areas

  - Additional areas may be designated as [bold]Secure Area[/bold]s by any CIC personnel. These are not considered a FOB, and their secure status may be revoked for any reason by any CIC personnel.
  - These areas dictate where certain shipside personnel are allowed to be given permission to work.
  - These areas are no longer secure if there is a breach or the area is being attacked by hostiles.

  ## Field hospitals

  - It must be designated as a [bold]Secure Area.[/bold]
  - The field hospital must be designated as such by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] or [bold]Chief Medical Officer[/bold].


  ## Primary Landing Zones

  - Selected for the entire duration of the operation by the COMMANDER.
  - The primary landing zone must be reinforced with a minimum of a line of non-makeship defenses, including stationed marines.

  ## Conduct of Briefing

  The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] is to ensure a proper briefing before any operation is being held.
