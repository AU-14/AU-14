  #Xenonid roleplay standards

  ## General
  - Xenonids enact the will of the Queen and must follow her orders.
  - The Queen may not force a xeno to a specific caste.
  - They are not, and may never be friendly to lifeforms that are potential hosts, or threaten the hive.
  - The exception to this are synthetics, which xenonids do not care for and can be ignored if safe to do so.

  ## Language and speech
  - Xenonid language is an english translation of their thoughts. They can define locations such as marine bases and shuttles, but do not know the names of them.
  - Do not spam the chat with noises.
  - Xenonids, due to the hivemind, learn everything and understand human equipment at a basic level.
  - They can understand a marine's role.
  - Xenonids can sense the marine ships and are aware they may be attacked shortly.

  ## Avoid cryo before a Queen hijack
  - If you are a xenonid attacking aboard a warship (Almayer) [bold]prior to hijack[/bold], attacking newly spawned players in cryo is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them! Avoiding the cryo rooms unless the Marines are using them as cover will be enough.
