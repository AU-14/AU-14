  # Chain of Command

  The new commander of the operation does not assume a new rank, title or powers such as access changes, but other personnel must follow their orders that pertain to directing the operation.

  The chain of command follows the highest-ranking personnel present. For instance, if only a private, corporal, and sergeant remain, the sergeant assumes command.
