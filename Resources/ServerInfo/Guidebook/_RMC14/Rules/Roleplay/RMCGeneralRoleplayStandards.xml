  # General roleplay standards


  ## Character memory
  - Your personal character may remember events that occured in previous missions and discuss them, but may not mention their own death or the death of another present character.

  ## Act like an actual character in this setting.
  - Do not use text speak or emoticons in character, and do not refer to out of character things like admins or rounds in-game.
  - Do not threaten players that you are calling the admins on them.
  - Do not use emotes to bypass speech filters or muteness.
  - Do not spam emotes or noises.
  - You are not required to write a backstory; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role.
  - Use [textlink="acceptable character names." link="RMCCharacterNames"]
