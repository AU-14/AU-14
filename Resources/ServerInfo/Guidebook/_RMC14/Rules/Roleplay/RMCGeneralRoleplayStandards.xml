  # General roleplay standards


  ## Character memory
  - Your personal character may remember events that occured in previous missions and discuss them, but may not mention their own death or the death of another present character.

  ## Act like an actual character in this setting.
  - Do not use text speak or emoticons in character, and do not refer to out of character things like admins or rounds in-game.
  - Do not threaten players that you are calling the admins on them.
  - Do not use emotes to bypass speech filters or muteness.
  - You are not required to write a backstory; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role.
  - Some actions have no delay to make gameplay like reloading smoother. Do not abuse this to spam any kind of sounds.
  - Do not reference memes in character, on any faction, including substituting letters on a meme as a Xenonid.
  - Use [textlink="acceptable character names." link="RMCCharacterNames"]

  ## Suicides
  - You must have a valid roleplay reason to commit suicide.
  - Starting and then cancelling a suicide will be treated the same as an actual suicide, and also requires a valid reason.
  - Suiciding at round-end without a valid roleplay reason will be considered end-of-round grief and result in the same ban.

  Valid suicide examples:
  - Suiciding as a survivor in a last stand scenario, when it is clear that you will be captured by xenonids and there is no hope of fighting back.
  - Suiciding to avoid being captured by a hostile force.
  - Suiciding if you fail to evac in a post-hijack evacuation of the Almayer.

  Not valid suicide examples:
  - Suiciding at round end without a valid roleplay reason. Going out after a victory is not a valid reason.
  - Suiciding in briefing.
  - Suiciding to spite someone or because you want to stop playing the round.
  - Suiciding after receiving bad orders.
  - Suiciding at round-start because you didn't get the role you wanted.
  - Suiciding at memorial in remembrance of fallen marines.
  - Suiciding because you are wounded.

  If you are not sure if you have a valid reason, AHelp (F1) to ask.

  ## Metagaming/Powergaming

  Some parts of the game cannot be covered by mechanics to ensure proper roleplay and balance.

  - Surrounding a comms tower or APC entirely with reinforced walls to prevent Xenonids attacking it [bold]without T3s[/bold] is not allowed. This is usually only relevant in the early game.\nWalls can be used to cover most of the object, however there must remain access for other xenos IE barricades.\nThis rule is no longer applied as soon as a T3 Xenonid has been witnessed.
  - Xenonids also cannot surround a comms tower or APC entirely with walls, but can make an accessable room of it with a resin door.
  - Exploitation of any current game bugs. You can ask in ahelp if something is a bug to avoid this.
