  # RMC-14 Rules

  [bold]If you are unable to click any links, use the in-game guidebook version, in the escape menu.[/bold]

  [italic]RMC is a roleplaying game with team deathmatch elements. This means players are expected, to an extent, to pretend their character is part of this world in their actions and words. This is the intended experience, and the experience the players of RMC enjoy, and is not always about winning.[/italic]

  ## Recent Changes
  Read the relevant sections for the entire text.
  - Marine Law and SOP has been added. Command level roles including Squad Leaders must follow this.
  - Many sections of the rules have been changed. It's recommended to read everything.

  ## Admin Decisions Are Final.
  - Rules are enforced as intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be written, thus enforcement is subject to admin interpretation of the rule’s intention.
  - Admins may handle rule breaks through in-character consequences at their discretion. This does not apply to zero tolerance rules.
  - You may file a staff complaint with head staff if you find the decision to be incorrect.

  ## General Information
  Disconnecting from or ignoring/evading admin-helps will result in an appeal only ban.
  This is to prevent bad actors from avoiding issues. If you need to leave urgently, let us know and it will be considered in your appeal.


  All of the below rules apply at all times, including between rounds.

  These rules are neither exactly SS14 or CM13 and should be read in their entirety.
