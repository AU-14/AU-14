  # Charging and sentencing

  [italic]This procedure is subject to change, with new brig timer technology in the future.[/italic]

  Upon arrest, the arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] must transfer the suspect to the brig, where they will have the suspect charged with the crimes committed, by another member of the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color].
  - Brig timers must not exceed 30 minutes unless in the case of a [bold]Capital Crime[/bold], or if extended by crimes performed while jailed.
  - Charging is to be done, in order of availability, by the Military Warden, the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color], an uninvolved [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color], the arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color].
  - If any of these are present they may explicitly defer to the next in-line if their attention is required elsewhere. This right should be used reasonably.
  - The person issuing the charges should also determine a sentence.
  - Inform the Suspect of their Charges before the brig timer starts.
  - Inform the Suspect they may file an appeal should they wish so.
