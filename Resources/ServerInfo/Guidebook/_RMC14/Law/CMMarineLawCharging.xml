  # Charging and sentencing

  [italic]This procedure is subject to change, with new brig timer technology in the future.[/italic]

  ## General Procedure
  Upon arrest, the arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] must transfer the suspect to the brig, where they will have the suspect charged with the crimes committed, by another member of the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color].
  - Brig timers must not exceed 30 minutes unless in the case of a [bold]Capital Crime[/bold], or if extended by crimes performed while jailed.
  - Charging is to be done, in order of availability, by the Military Warden, the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color], an uninvolved [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color], the arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color].
  - If any of these are present they may explicitly defer to the next in-line if their attention is required elsewhere. This right should be used reasonably.
  - The person issuing the charges should also determine a sentence.
  - Inform the Suspect of their Charges before the brig timer starts.
  - Inform the Suspect they may file an appeal should they wish so.

  ## Additional charging of Military Police
  - [bold]Always ensure you are permitted to arrest them, first.[/bold]
  - They are to be charged with neglect of duty as an aditional crime. This does not upgrade minor crimes to major.
  - Should their appeal or pardon be denied, they are to be removed from service as law enforcement.
  - If they are removed, and of enlisted rank, they are to serve in squad roles, other assignments by permission of the Heads of departments, or direct assignment by the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color]
  - If they are removed, and of Officer rank, they are to serve in CIC unless dismissed by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] to find duties elsewhere.
