\n

[color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color]: The Chief of Military Police, assigned to the warship.

Charges: Upon arrest, the arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] has to transfer the arrestee to secure custody, where they will seek to have the arrestee charged with the crimes committed. Charging is to be done, in order of availability, by the Military Warden, the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color], an uninvolved [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color], the arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color].
- If any of these are present they may explicitly defer to the next in-line if their attention is required elsewhere. This right should be used reasonably.
- The person issuing the charges should also determine a sentence, in accordance with sentencing procedure.
- Sentencing is to be graded according to the intensity of the charges provided, as well as any modifying factors.
- This is subject to change, with new brig timer technology in the future.

Immunity: If a person is defined to have immunity, they may not be searched, arrested or charged without permission from those with the defined overriding authority.

\n

# This should be moved to it's own section
NJP: Defined as a Non-Judicial-Punishment. This may include laps, cleaning the area affected by a crime or otherwise restoring it to a proper state, or any other punishment that is of comparable severity.
  - An arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may decide to replace any charges for minor crimes which would realistically be sentenced for no more than 10 minutes confinement with the offer for an NJP.
  - An NJP may be offered only once for a given charge.
    - If rejected, the charges must be pressed as normal.
    - If accepted, the arrestee waives the right to appeal.
  - The decision to grant or not grant an NJP may be overruled by ranking [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] personnel, an SEA or the Commanding Officer.
  - An NJP may not take longer than the time of confinement for the charges that would have been placed instead, provided the punished individual does their due dilligence to complete the NJP in a reasonable manner.
