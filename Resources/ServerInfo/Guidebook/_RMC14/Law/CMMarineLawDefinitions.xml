# This should be moved to it's own section
NJP: Defined as a Non-Judicial-Punishment. This may include laps, cleaning the area affected by a crime or otherwise restoring it to a proper state, or any other punishment that is of comparable severity.
  - An arresting [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may decide to replace any charges for minor crimes which would realistically be sentenced for no more than 10 minutes confinement with the offer for an NJP.
  - An NJP may be offered only once for a given charge.
    - If rejected, the charges must be pressed as normal.
    - If accepted, the arrestee waives the right to appeal.
  - The decision to grant or not grant an NJP may be overruled by ranking [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] personnel, an SEA or the Commanding Officer.
  - An NJP may not take longer than the time of confinement for the charges that would have been placed instead, provided the punished individual does their due dilligence to complete the NJP in a reasonable manner.
