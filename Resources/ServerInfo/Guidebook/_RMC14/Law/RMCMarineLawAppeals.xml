  # Right to Appeal
  Appeals are used to correct errors, but may not be used to add new charges or punishments if a brig timer was already set.

  ## Appeal a Sentence in a timely manner
  - Anyone under the jurisdiction of marine law has the right to appeal their punishment to their choice of either the CMP** or the Commander**, who may also choose to designate someone else to handle the appeal in their place. If either person picked is involved in the crimes, they should designate an uninvolved MP** or commissioned officer.
