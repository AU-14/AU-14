  #Your first day as a rifleman!

  - Just woke up from cryosleep? Well you're probably hungry, so you should head to the food vendor.

  - And finally, visit the automated weapons rack to pick a weapon and mags to go with it!
  We recommend the M41A Pulse Rifle for beginners.
  - Also make sure to grab a few armor piercing (AP) mags for the heavier xenos!

  - Now you're ready to kill xenomorphs! Try to find the meeting room with your squadmates if the operation hasn't started yet.
  - Otherwise, ask around for help finding the dropship and get in there!
