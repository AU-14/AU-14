  #Colonial Marines 14 Rules

  ##Recent Changes
  - Rules moved to guidebook.
  - Nicknames allowed on humanoid characters.

  ##Admin decisions are final.
  - Rules are enforced as intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be written, thus enforcement is subject to admin interpretation of the rule’s intention.
  - Admins may handle rule breaks through in-character consequences at their discretion.
    - This does not apply to zero tolerance rules.
    - You may file a staff complaint with head staff if you find the decision to be incorrect.

  YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY CM14. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.

  Disconnecting from or ignoring/evading admin-helps will result in an appeal only ban.

  This is to prevent bad actors from avoiding issues. If you need to leave urgently, let us know and it will be considered in your appeal.


  All of the below rules apply at all times, including between rounds.
  These rules are neither exactly SS14 or CM13 and should be read in their entirety.
