  #Xeno roleplay standards

  #General
  - Xenos enact the will of the Queen.
  - They are not, and may never be friendly.
  - The exception to this are synthetics, which xenos do not care for and can be ignored if safe to do so.
  - The Queen may banish xenos who do not follow these rules.
  - Banished xenomorphs are exempt from hive protection and may be killed.
  - Xenomorphs should not be rushing onto the dropship before they witness the dropship drop twice at minimum.
  - Xenomorphs can use the hivemind to report drops.

  #Language and speech
  - Xeno language is an english translation of their thoughts. They can define locations such as marine bases and shuttles, but do not know the names of them.
  - Do not spam the chat with noises.
  - Xenos, due to the hivemind, learn everything and understand human equipment at a basic level.
  - They can understand a marine's role.
  - Xenos can sense the marine ships and are aware they may be attacked shortly.
