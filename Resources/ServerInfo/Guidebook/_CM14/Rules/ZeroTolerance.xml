ZERO TOLERANCE RULES

You are liable to be permanently banned for breaking these rules with no warning.

[color=#a4885c]Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, racism, specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), sexism, disability-related or anything even remotely similar.
[italic](note: In the lore of CM14, Nanotrasen workers (and their various humanoid species) have been contracted over to the USCM to build a larger force in exchange for protection of their stations, and have been working for the USCM for a long time. They should be treated as any regular human.)[/italic]

[color=#a4885c]Absolutely no sexual content or Erotic Roleplay (ERP), including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions.
- The server is 16+, not 18+.

[color=#a4885c]Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game. This is referred to as "Metacomming".
- Admins cannot police metacommunication, we must assume it is being abused. (All involved will be actioned on.)
[italic](It would alienate squad-mates not using the same method of communication and is not permitted.)[/italic]

[color=#a4885c]Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appeal-able after six months and only with a voucher of good behavior from another SS13/SS14 server.
- Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban.

[color=#a4885c]Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt the server in any way.
- This includes auto clickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection.

End of round grief of your own faction is not permitted and results in an instant 3 hour ban.
