[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY CM14. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]
This is to prevent bad actors from avoiding issues. If you need to leave urgently, let us know and it will be considered in your appeal.

You can find clarifications of any ambiguity on our discord.

[color=#ff0000]Recent Changes[/color]
    - This is the first creation of CM14 rules!

[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] [color=#ff0000]Admin decisions are final.[/color] Rules are enforced as intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to admin interpretation of the ruleâ€™s intention. Admins may choose to handle minor rule breaks by "In-Character" consequences. Admins have discretion on when a minor rule break can be handled via "In-Character" consequences. Admins will not use "In-Character" consequences for zero tolerance rules. Players cannot request an admin to handle things "In-Character" and the final decision rests solely on the Admin. You may file a staff report with head staff if you believe the ruling to be incorrect. Do not argue with the game admins.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#ff0000]You are liable to be permanently banned for breaking these rules with no warning.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, racism, specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), sexism, disability-related or anything even remotely similar.
[italic](note: In the lore of CM14, Nanotrasen workers (and their various humanoid species) have been contracted over to the USCM to build a larger force in exchange for protection of their stations, and have been working for the USCM for a long time. They should be treated as any regular human.)[/italic]

[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Absolutely no sexual content or Erotic Roleplay (ERP), including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. The server is open to 16+, not 18+. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming". Adminstrators cannot police metacommunications, we must assume it is being abused. (All involved will be actioned on.)[/italic]
[italic](note: While we are generally okay with the concept of squads having metacomms, we came to the conclusion that it would alienate squad-mates not using the same method of communication and should not be permitted.)[/italic]

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months and only with a voucher of good behavior from another SS13/SS14 server. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban.

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC. We cannot moderate other languages, nor do we want people to be left out of conversations.

[color=#a4885c]07.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt the server in any way. This includes autoclickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]08.[/color] Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play (referred to as "multi-keying"). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned. This is to prevent players from having respawns and will be treated as such.

[color=#a4885c]09.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it with spam. Don't bother checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), just send your issue. Hostility to administators will likely result in your removal.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name (leeway is given to for non-human races).
    - Names of famous or fictional persons or names that resemble/parody them are strictly forbidden. Terrible names open you up to being politely reminded to change it, smited, or instantly banned, depending on severity.
    - Names resulting in inappropriate phonetic play-on-words are forbidden (ex: "Mike Oxlong", "Ben Dover", "Dixie Normus").

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Act like an actual human being. Do not use text speak or emoticons IC, and do not refer to OOC things like admins in-game. Do not threaten players that you are calling the admins on them. Do not use emotes to bypass speech filters or muteness. You are not required to write a backstory or follow strict procedure; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
    - [color=#ff0000] Attacking newly spawned players in cryo is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color]
    - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
    - [color=#ff0000]End of round grief of your own faction is not permitted and may result in an instant 3 hour ban.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
    - Annoying players for IC reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they have interacted with you is not.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage ("Metagaming").
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character (i.e spectating while a ghost, metacomms, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for slipping you, use common sense. Do not start riots.
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Military Police may use less-lethal force to effect arrests of criminals.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to Medbay.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
    - Strikes, revolutions, riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without permission. All players, including hostile forces, must obtain admin permission before engaging in this behavior.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Don't immediately ghost or suicide from your role if you do not get the role you want, or from head roles without notifying your chain of command or administrators.
    - This is not fair to other players actually waiting patiently for a round of that role. Alternatively, if you do not want to play a role, do not opt-in for it.
    - Command roles help drive rounds. If you need to leave, please admin-help your role and that you are leaving. There is no need to wait for a reply when admin-helping that you need to disconnect as a head role.

[color=#a4885c]17.[/color] Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other then to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").
    - A doctor does not need a rifle. Have an actual reason for needing these things, for example if there is a confirmed threat of hostile forces on the ship.
    - Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or death poisons before first contact.

[color=#a4885c]18.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an hostile force is forbidden.
    - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces as a crew member.

[color=#ff0000]Military Police & COMMAND RULES[/color]
These rules also apply to any individual who is promoted or is acting in the place of a MP/Command role (unless they are a member of a hostile force).

[color=#a4885c]19.[/color] Command and MP are held to a higher standard of play.
    - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.
    - Do not willingly and openly cooperate with terrorists/hostile forces. Some leeway is given to making deals with hostile forces if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the ship as a whole and not just yourself.
    - Uphold the Law & maintain order. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior. MP is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible. Command are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to MP.
    - Do not immediately abandon your position as a Command role and go do whatever you want instead of managing your department/the ship. Do not abuse your position or use it to make arbitrary choices to the detriment of the ship.
    - Do not abandon the ship during a raid. You are supposed to protect the ship and it's crew, not let hostile forces kill everyone on it without a fight.

[color=#a4885c]20.[/color] MP should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests, except in the following special circumstances, where they may choose to use lethal force:
    - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, disabling/stunning weapons, deadly melee weapons)
    - Suspect is wearing clothing or showing immediately dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/hostile forces when applicable.
    - You determine that your life or the life of an innocent is in immediate danger.
    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continually manages to escape.
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the ship/crew.

MP will be expected to answer for use of lethal force. Military Police will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used. MP is strongly encouraged, but not required, to revive hostiles and effect a permabrigging or other sentence as deemed appropriate.

[color=#a4885c]21.[/color] MP are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the ship at large to do so.
    - Brig times should generally not exceed 10 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable. Repeat offenders or hostile forces may be permabrigged.
    - Military Police may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commission crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be revived unless they have been (legally) executed, or have committed suicide.
    - Executions must be for a permabriggable crime, and approved by the highest member in the chain of command, who will answer for approving it alongside Military Police's chain of command. Those who willingly attempt to damage/destroy or escape from the permabrig may be executed.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with, as well as basic medical aid, at least to the point they are no longer at risk of dying.
