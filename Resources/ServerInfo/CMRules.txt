[color=#ff0000]IN GAME RULES[/color]

 [color=#a4885c]Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.[/color]
    - [color=#ff0000] Attacking newly spawned players in cryo is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color] This only applies to hostiles on the ship prior to a hijack.
    - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
    - Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an hostile force is forbidden.
    - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces as a crew member.

 [color=#a4885c]Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)[/color]
    - Annoying players for IC reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they have interacted with you is not.

 [color=#a4885c]Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage ("Metagaming").[/color]
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character's view and hearing to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you do not remember anything from your past life.

 [color=#a4885c]Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for annoying you, use common sense.[/color]
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life, if the attacker is not a hostile force.
    - Military Police may use less-lethal force to effect arrests of criminals.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to Medbay if they are not a hostile force.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.

 [color=#a4885c]All players, including hostile forces, must obtain admin permission before engaging riots, mutinies or similar activity.[/color]
        - Strikes, revolutions, riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without permission.
        - Staff reserve the right to grant or deny mutinies, and to decide if the reason given is sufficient.
        - MPs are not able to mutiny and will always side with the acting CO.
        - Mutiny cannot occur during hijack, and any ongoing mutiny must be ended upon hijack.
        - Only the Acting Commander can be mutinied against. They must be given a chance to stand down peacefully.
        - During the mutiny, attacking any uninvolved, medical, or surrendered personnel is forbidden, as is perma-killing anyone involved.
            - If you have surrendered during a mutiny, you must remain as such.
            - You may not change sides unless you are surrendering.
        - Once concluded, all sides must be given medical treatment. CO or higher are able to deny treatment or battlefield execute mutineers.
        - Mutinies must have 5 members minimum.
        - Examples of mutiny reasons:
            - Commander incompetence, where the next in line would lead better.
            - Commander takes no actions in leading.
            - Commander refuses to allow evacuation.

 [color=#a4885c]Don't immediately ghost, suicide, or disconnect from your role if you do not get the role you want, or from head roles without notifying your chain of command or an admin.[/color]
    - If you do not want to play a role, do not opt-in for it.
    - Command roles help drive rounds. If you need to leave, use cryo or please admin-help your role and that you are leaving.
        - There is no need to wait for a reply when admin-helping that you need to disconnect as a head role.

[color=#ff0000]Military Police & COMMAND RULES[/color]

 These rules also apply to any individual who is promoted or is acting in the place of a MP/Command role (unless they are a member of a hostile force).

 Marine law is not yet created for this server, however, https://cm-ss13.com/wiki/Marine_Law may be used for crimes and punishments in the sections from "Optional" to "Precautionary Charges".
    - Laws are interpreted through chain of command, and a decision may be overruled by a higher position.

 [color=#a4885c]Command and MP are held to a higher standard of play.[/color]
    - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.
    - Do not willingly and openly cooperate with terrorists/hostile forces.
        - Some leeway is given to making deals with hostile forces if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the ship as a whole and not just yourself.

        - MP is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible.
        - Command are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to MP.
    - Do not immediately abandon your position as a Command role to do things unrelated to your role.

 [color=#a4885c]MP should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests, except in the following special circumstances, where they may choose to use lethal force:[/color]
    - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, disabling/stunning weapons, deadly melee weapons)
    - Suspect is wearing clothing or showing immediately dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/hostile forces when applicable.
    - You determine that your life or the life of an innocent is in immediate danger.
    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continually manages to escape.
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the ship/crew.

 [color=#a4885c]MP will be expected to answer for use of lethal force.[/color]
 - Military Police will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used.
 - MP is strongly encouraged, but not required, to revive hostiles and effect a permabrigging or other sentence as deemed appropriate.

 [color=#a4885c]MP are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the ship at large to do so.[/color]
    - Brig times should generally not exceed 10 minutes unless the crime is permabrig-able.
        - Repeat offenders or hostile forces may be perma-brigged.
    - Military Police may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commission crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be revived unless they have been (legally) executed, or have committed suicide.
    - Executions must be for a executable crime, and approved by a (not acting) CO , who will answer for approving it.
        - Those who willingly attempt to damage/destroy or escape from the permabrig may be executed.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with, as well as basic medical aid, at least to the point they are no longer at risk of dying.
